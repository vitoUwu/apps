 * 
 * >ℹ️ If you wish to configure lead time exclusively, use the [Update inventory lead time by SKU and warehouse](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/api-reference/logistics-api#patch-/api/logistics/pvt/inventory/skus/-skuId-/warehouses/-warehouseId-/lead-time) endpoint, and if the quantity only, use the [Update inventory quantity by SKU and warehouse](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/api-reference/logistics-api#patch-/api/logistics/pvt/inventory/skus/-skuId-/warehouses/-warehouseId-/quantity) endpoint. 
 * 
 * This endpoint allows you to: 
 * 
 * - **Define a quantity:** Indicate a specific number of items of a SKU from a warehouse, and it will decrease whenever an item is sold. When the last item is sold, the SKU will run out of stock. 
 * 
 * - **Set an unlimited inventory:** Always have items of a SKU from a warehouse considered available for sale. When this configuration is active, the SKU never goes out of stock. 
 * 
 * - **Configure lead time:** Set the [lead time](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/lead-time-shipping-time-at-sku-level--16yv5Mkj6bTyWR1hCN2f4B) for a given SKU from a warehouse, and this period will be added to the order total shipping time. This configuration is optional and by default it is set to `0` days. 
 * 
 * Successful requests receive a `200 OK` status code with `true` in the response body, and unsuccessful requests receive a `400 Bad Request` error code. 
 * 
 * >❗ Requests made with an incomplete response body can be successful and receive a `200 OK` message.

 * ## Permissions
 * 
 * Any user or [API key](https://developers.vtex.com/docs/guides/api-authentication-using-api-keys) must have at least one of the appropriate [License Manager resources](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/license-manager-resources--3q6ztrC8YynQf6rdc6euk3) to be able to successfully run this request. Otherwise they will receive a status code `403` error. These are the applicable resources for this endpoint:
 * 
 * | **Product** | **Category** | **Resource** |
 * | --------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- |
 * | Logistics | Logistics access | **Logistics full access** |
 * | Logistics | Logistics access | **Logistics viewer** |
 * 
 * You can [create a custom role](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/roles--7HKK5Uau2H6wxE1rH5oRbc#creating-a-role) with that resource or use one of the following [predefined roles](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/predefined-roles--jGDurZKJHvHJS13LnO7Dy):

 * >❗ Assigning a [predefined role](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/predefined-roles--jGDurZKJHvHJS13LnO7Dy) to users or application keys usually grants permission to multiple [License Manager resources](https://help.vtex.com/en/tutorial/license-manager-resources--3q6ztrC8YynQf6rdc6euk3).
